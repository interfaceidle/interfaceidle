His wallet is missing, but there's a small badge in one pocket that identifies him as Dr. Edward Kawakami from the University of New Boston. As you crouch over him, he starts to stir. You notice a distinctive red gleam in his eyes as he opens them.\n\nHe's wearing interface contacts! Those things are worth a fortune!\n\nThey'll be tuned to his biometric signature, but there are ways around that. Whatever you choose, this is the biggest opportunity of your lifetime."
